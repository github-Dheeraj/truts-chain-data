No brands are affiliated, connected or associated in any way with 1,989 Sisters. The collection also includes eight sets of twins and one set of triplets. This was not by design, but a serendipitous accident as @blairz is a twin and was born in 1989, which was the inspiration for the collection name and number of Sisters.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit www.blairbreitenstein.com/nft-collection\r\n\r\nJoin our community on Discord: discord.gg/sisters",

Each piece is a dissected fragment from the wider transformative narrative arc, and we see all character in chronological states of metamorphosis. The intricately crafted textures transform from solid earthbound state into the ethereal representation of the translucent meshes which allow our inner light to transfer to our outside world. Aitor Throup\u2019s recently revealed and long awaited multi-dimensional odyssey is a conceptual exploration of chaos, balance and higher consciousness. The three main characters of this epic tale are conceptual representations of the human struggle to find harmony through the imbalance of life. \u2018Lil Yin\u2019 and \u2018Lil Yang\u2019 are monochromatic expressions of energetic polarity.",

From a lifelong fascination of digital worlds and 3D graphics from playing video games, Alexis became frustrated with the lack of modern aesthetics represented therein. The images he creates are a simple extension of this desire to see fantastic spaces come to life that echo a more modern and clean aesthetic. What started as a humble creative pursuit, has led to international exhibitions and a design studio with a never-ending desire to innovate within the realm of 3D, product design and virtual space creation. His explorations have caught the eye of brands around the world and his ever-growing client list now includes Wallpaper, Ignant, Bang&Olufsen, LG, Facebook, Microsoft and many more.",

From painting on canvas, building huge cosplay costumes and now her love for the digital arts, she continues to draw, model and build costumes despite having an hereditary illness called Muscular Dystrophy. Muscular Dystrophy is a illness that causes certain muscles of the body to atrophy (weakened or wearing away of muscles) This illness has started to effect her abilities to draw and with this realization she wanted to recreate some of her favorite paints in digital form and start new artworks before she is unable to do so. Her lines may become more shaky or soon her artwork will no longer be but her passion and gratitude she has for the art community will remain.",

On mint, the NFT is given one of six animal types, but is initially blank. On the fourth transfer, the Animal's mood is revealed - the coloring and animation of its eyes. The 10x10 SVG art and animation are generated and stored entirely on-chain. [Erasers](https://opensea.io/collection/animal-coloring-book-eraser) go with this project.

The collection presents a series of poetic data sculptures and paintings of the Inspiration4 mission. \r\n\t\r\nFor this collection, Anadol and his team interpreted data from SpaceX and NASA-funded research institute TRISH (Translational Research Institute for Space Health) on the effects of space travel on the human body. TRISH conducts cutting-edge research into the impact that the conditions in space have on the astronauts, with an attempt to reduce the health risks of venturing deeper into the universe.\r\n\r\nAnadol\u2019s one-of-a-kind NFT collection not only reveals an insight into the challenges of space travel, but also contributes to a meaningful and purposeful cause to help solve critical health issues. 30% of all NFT sales will be donated to St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.\r\nIn collaboration with //CreativeWorkStudio.",

He works as a freelance 3D artist with a style mixing expressionism and surrealism, but himself says it\u2019s more of an abstract style. He likes to experiment with colors, sometimes using extremely desaturated tones, and likes his art to be sharp, saturated, and high contrast. The same goes with animations - he doesn't have any specific technique, but prefers his workflow to be with no boundaries.",

Mixing several art techniques to create a visual style that defies convention, this project explores traditional art forms that have yet to be used together in any other PFP project. From set design to sculpting, costuming to painting, each Average Creature has a vivid personality that truly redefines how we think of the word \u201caverage.\u201d",

As heroic as these legendary battles may appear, these tales could be viewed as metaphors for our own struggles with ideas that are beyond our comprehension, our existential clashes with the concept of a higher power.\n\nThe biblical figure of Jacob engages with his own conflict against a supernatural adversary, whom some have identified as an angel (Genesis 32:22-32). An important individual who was regarded as a patriarch of the Israelites, Jacob endured much strife throughout his life and reached a crisis point during his journey back to Canaan under the spectre of a family dispute that had his brother vowing to kill him. After making efforts to pacify his vengeful brother, an exhausted Jacob spent the night alone at the side of a river, where he encountered a mysterious figure who proceeded to wrestle with him until daybreak.\n\nThis Biblical encounter has been depicted in a variety of artworks throughout history, with artists such as Delacroix, Rembrandt, Redon, and Gauguin exploring this sense of inner conflict, typically under the title \u2018Jacob Wrestling with the Angel\u2019. Embracing this tradition and fusing it with a playful 21st Century twist, Trevor Jones has produced a unique NFT artwork entitled \u2018Peter Schiff Wrestling with the Angel\u2019.\n\nGauguin\u2019s painting depicts the wrestling figures of Jacob and the angel observed by a prayer gathering. The artist remarked that \u201cfor me in this painting, the landscape and the fight exist only in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon\u2026\u201d. Reflecting this sense of the mind\u2019s eye, Jones has drawn a parallel between Jacob\u2019s struggle with the angel and renowned US stockbroker and financial commentator Peter Schiff\u2019s struggle with cryptocurrency.\n\nPeter Schiff is something of a cryptocurrency \u2018non-believer\u2019, having issued scathing criticisms of Bitcoin, believing that it does not represent a genuine tangible asset, such as real-estate or gold. In Jones\u2019s work Schiff replaces Jacob. His adversary takes the traditional form of an angel, however in Jones\u2019s oeuvre angels have additional layers of symbological significance, often alluding to the almighty economic forces that influence cryptocurrency, such as that depicted in Jones\u2019s \u2018The Bitcoin Angel\u2019.\n\nWith its energetic vivid palette, striking angles, and shapes, and the accompanying powerful NFT animation, \u2018Peter Schiff Wrestling with the Angel\u2019 is a unique coalescence of historical art and cutting-edge technology that regards the past and the future in equal measure. There is a sense of wry humour to the work but also an acknowledgment of the existential themes of the source material reshaped into a battle between financial dogma and a shift towards digital currency.",

What initially began as a joke between him and his wife in 2012 quickly became a desire to answer a question: Could he change the meaning of an unwanted piece of artwork without drastically altering its aesthetic and make it wanted again? Since that time he\u2019s completed hundreds of paintings and his work has been displayed and found in homes, galleries, businesses, and private collections in all 50 states and in over 40 countries around the world. His work has attracted attention from the media both in the U.S. and abroad, including Business Insider, Instagram, Hypebeast, HiFructose, the SyFy Channel, and more. His corporate clients include SONY, Instagram, McDonalds, New Balance, and others.",

DeadTedz have one goal: to bring about the Bear Apocalypse.\n\nAll this bear abuse is providing dark dividends for our members: prize draws, competitions, and staking have rewarded DeadTedz with more than $2 million. NFT staking is a first-in-class reward system that is currently exclusive to our beloved DeadTedz.\n\nWanton bear destruction ain't easy! That's why we grew our Treasury from 150 ETH to OVER 800 ETH by investing in the great Floki bull of 2021. This enabled Deadbears to become the first NFT project to return more rewards to members than we raised from mint. \n\nWe will continue the Bear hunt in the future by expanding the treasury with more crypto giants. This will allow us to continue to deliver value and rewards to our loyal DeadTedz long into the next Bearmagedon. \n\nLet's get those bears!",

This collection is an ode to generative art from projects like Art Blocks, inspired by works such as Chromie Squiggles, Fidenzas, and Ringers. To learn more about this project, visit the Drip Drop website on ALLSHIPS and join the Dave Krugman Discord. \n\n100 mints are held for future. \n\n\u2018Drip Drop\u2019 is a study of the generative beauty of the universe, as viewed through the lens of rain hitting puddles in Times Square. Color spectrums emerge from bright billboards, and wash over textured water, highlighting the beauty at the intersection of nature and civilization. At the overlap of these worlds, gorgeous patterns emerge. Each Drip is a slide to be studied- a cross section of entropy and energy. \n\n\u2018Drip Drop\u2019 is a collaboration between Dave Krugman and Transient Labs. The team built a custom machine vision algorithm that sorts and batches Drips based on their emergent rarities. ",

Speaking on his collection, Esteban wrote, 'Lifeforms is an experimental approach to character design. Instead of meticulously crafting and modeling elements, I designed a pipeline in which you feed a human looking 3D model and on the other end you end up with these glass and steel beings. The whole collection/concept came to mind after considering how much time we spend actually grasping to our phones, a glass and steel extension of our beings. I tried to imagine would would happen if eventually those elements take over and grow into us, using patterns and shapes you would find in nature.'",

Their process-based approach through making is most notable in their works on wood, silkscreen printing, ceramic tiles and arcade art populated by an iconic cast of figures that build on design and craft traditions. These explorations of duality, both fantastic and provocative have, over two decades, pushed the boundaries of their genre.",

            "description": "Multidisciplinary visual artist James Jean presents Fragments (2022), a new series of hand-drawn digital artworks commissioned by the digital art platform Outland. The new and ambitious series is inspired by a forthcoming large-scale, luminous architectural pavilion by the artist, titled Pagoda, that will be composed of 7,000 stained glass pieces. Fragments will be minted as an edition size of 7,000 NFTs to reflect the physical sculpture that will be unveiled in 2023.\r\n\r\nFragments is entirely hand-drawn and presents a series of fantastical characters that are distilled from the artist\u2019s imagination. Jean describes these as \u201cmythic beings\u201d and each character bears a unique persona on a pentagonal frame, echoing the petal-like shape of the Pagoda\u2019s glass panels, in his signature psychedelic colour palette. Fragments features visual elements that have appeared within Jean\u2019s works throughout his career.",

            "description": "Gareth Emery is an artist that intersects the worlds of music and crypto. As a musician, he\u2019s been one of the world\u2019s leading DJ producers for over 15 years, amassing hundreds of millions of streams and a social media audience of over 4 million. And on the crypto side, he served as CEO of early crypto music streaming startup Choon from 2017-2019, which he started alongside Cryptopunks founders Matt Hall and John Watkinson, setting the stage for 2021\u2019s revolution in music NFTs.\n\nLSR/CITY (pronounced \u201claser city\u201d) is a collision between lasers, music, and digital art full of world firsts. Using the technology from Gareth\u2019s epic laser concerts, which are seen by millions each year, Gareth and laser designer Photon filmed intricately choreographed laser shows using a variety of shutter speeds and lenses to create mind bending patterns, before displaying each show inside beautifully rendered glass cubes in a series of cities designed by 3D artist Ilya Tsvetkov.",

My heart goes out to the thousands of innocent people fleeing their homes because of a senseless war. While sitting half way across the world I felt helpless but compelled to act and create. With the motivation of my NFT collecting community and a box of spray paint, I knew I could help in some way.\u201d - Tristan Eaton\r\n\r\nFounded by Sean Penn and Ann Lee, CORE is a global crisis response organization dedicated to empowering underserved communities in and beyond crisis. In rapid response to the urgent humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, CORE was one of the first organizations supporting refugees in Poland and Romania, where it continues to provide critical support.",

Each art piece is composed of rubberized statue fragments that are magnetized towards one another other, culminating in collision and disarray. \n\nThese 81 GLUEWAVE artworks are special, not just for their entrancing details, but for their ability to propagate. Underneath all the chaos is a DNA sequence that encodes the top, middle and bottoms statue fragments. During the breeding period (AUG 27 2021 - NOV 27 2021) a triplet of artworks can comingle their DNA and generate a new piece, one never-before-seen.\n\nGLUEWAVE collectors can intelligently breed their pieces and reassemble their statues. However, this feat will not be easy; completed statues will be exceedingly rare. Those who seek an even more arduous challenge can follow the secret dragon path, where unrevealed statues are unlocked.",

No two Hashrunes are alike. Once a name is claimed, its Hashrune **can't** be minted again. Hashrunes are **very scarce** due to an increasing minting fee. There are two editions: **Genesis Hashrunes** are the original Hashrunes with a pure design. **First Edition Hashrunes** have a corner design that distinguishes them from Genesis Hashrunes. They have a maximum supply. Genesis owners can mint their First Edition versions for free (other people can't mint them). To mint, visit **[Hashrunes.com](https://www.hashrunes.com)**.",

The 3D animated artworks from his daily GIF series have been featured in publications like The Guardian, Washington Post, Fast Company, and CBC Arts. Since 2014, these daily animations have been viewed over 1.4 billion times on Giphy. Previous clients include Nike, Nissan, BBC Two, and Jai Wolf.\r\n\r\nUnder the name Giraffage, electronic music producer Charlie Yin earned a considerable amount of acclaim for his dreamy, slightly melancholic sample-based songs that draw from influences including R&B, hip-hop, J-pop, and ambient music. Yin has received considerable attention for his remixes of popular R&B songs and solo tracks. He has performed as Giraffage at numerous locations worldwide, including Coachella, Outside Lands, Boiler Room, Low End Theory, and more. His music has won praise from blogs such as Pitchfork, XLR8R, and The FADER. His songs have been described as \"pleasantly ambient and sample-laden instrumentals\", or \"bedroom dream-pop\", and feature \"atmospheric pads ... familiar, hip-hop-flavored 808 percussion\", \"looping guitars, 808 thuds and clacks, and diced-up vocals\".",

After digitizing each LEGACYFORM, the dataset was processed through our GAN (Generative Adversarial Network). Over the course of two weeks, the neural network learned and interpreted the original drawings, thereby producing machine-generated variants that feel like an organic extension of the artist\u2019s work. J48BAFORMS offer an exciting array of rarities and styles, ranging from original hand drawn pieces to animated works with accompanying musical scores.",

            "description": "Jonathan Wolfe is a 21 year old Canadian artist, working primarily with paint and digital. Although recently he started exploring new mediums like clay, this process began with his first Nifty drop \u201cFabricated Fairytales\u201d, when he wanted to go beyond 2D images. Using clay brings colour and fun, two things that can describe Jonathan's art perfectly. His process involves making real life clay models, photographing them, then digitally drawing on these images to make them part of his artwork. This recent drop \u201cGrowing Up Got Old\u201d focuses heavily on the bright and playful nature the clay brings to the work, while also being inspired by nostalgia.\r\n\r\nOnly current holders of Jonathan's previous work titled 'Dream House' will be able to participate in the silent auction for 'Frog Stack.'",

The collection uses blockchain technology, digital artwork, scenes from Juicy\u2019s music videos, metadata, and instrumentals to tell Juicy J\u2019s story as a hip hop icon, cryptocurrency supporter, and cannabis entrepreneur. The pieces also commemorate Eternal Impact, the latest drop from ASTERISK*, an innovative cannabis brand founded by Juicy J and Gary Vee through his cannabis industry marketing agency Green Street.\r\n\r\nJuicy J, ASTERISK*, and Everipedia joined forces to create Juicy J\u2019s Journey, a collection of 5 NFT artworks with each piece limited to 84 editions for a total of only 420 pieces. All 5 NFT artworks contain beats co-produced by Juicy J and fans using his drum and loop kit. The collection also contains references to cryptocurrency and the IQ token. Juicy J has been an early supporter of blockchain technology. Back in February 2019 deep into crypto winter, he saw the potential in blockchain technology and invited Everipedia Co-Founder and President Sam Kazemian to include code from the IQ token in his \u201cLet Me See\u201d music video. This code was incorporated into the \u201cLet Me See That Code\u201d NFT which is one of the five NFT artworks that makes up this collection. Juicy is always hustling from rap to cannabis to crypto The Hustle Still Continues.  \r\n\r\nFor the ultimate trippy experience all 5 NFT artworks has been designed to be paired with Eternal Impact, the newest ASTERISK* cannabis strain developed by Juicy J.\r\n\r\n10 out of the 420 NFTs will be selected in July to give the holder a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smoke ASTERISK* cannabis with the trippiest man alive, Juicy J, on Instagram Live. Follow @therealjuicyj, @garyvee, and @everipedia on Twitter where we will be announcing the winning NFTs.\r\n\r\n360 of the 420 pieces are available for sale on OpenSea, the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplace, at a fixed price of 0.04201 ETH ensuring a fair distribution. 60 pieces will be reserved for ASTERISK* customers. 60 pieces will also be reserved for Everipedia\u2019s upcoming HighIQ staking platform which will reward IQ stakers with limited edition NFTs and IQ rewards. \r\n\r\nJuicy J is an Academy Award winning and Grammy nominated hip hop recording artist and record producer who\u2019s always had an eye for the future. \r\n\r\nGary Vee is a serial entrepreneur and marketing titan known for always being on the cutting edge from internet marketing to social media to cannabis to NFTs.\r\n\r\nEveripedia is a blockchain technology firm which is best known for creating the IQ token, an NFT, DeFi, and Oracle token dedicated to bringing all forms of knowledge on-chain from art to finance to data.",

Each subject represents a unique tarot card. I am creating a body of work focused on the existence of magic and mysticism through an immersive portrait survey and tarot readings. In the proverb of storytelling, psychics, and astrologers have an assigned position as the all-knowing gypsy with profound visions, within all concurrent and historical cultures\u2014a charged spirit of the ethereal that encompasses destiny, luck, and faith.  Combining the elements of the real (photographic) and the surreal (painting) to facilitate a broad & reflexive mixed-media dialogue that discerns the characters, their powers, and the significance of their presence in this natural world. So that together, we may raise the vibration of consciousness.",

Twins and multiple siblings provide a lens on the magic and causality of biology. In our everyday society, twins, triplets et al. have an assigned position within all current and historical cultures\u2014a shared tulpa of genetics, fate and timing. Twindom has a deep root in shared storytelling, its visuals conjure metatextual manifestations across the astrological, the mythological, the academic and the popular, stringing together tangents of the everyday and simultaneously karmic. By using three formats of film Polaroid, 120mm, and 4x5 by focusing on the simple idea of seeking an \u201cintentional phenomenology\u201d by direct image making, I can facilitate a broad and reflexive photographic engagement that is about these unique individuals.",

Emerging out of the tail-end of the vaporwave scene at the time, the album would go on to become an organic success story, gaining millions of listeners.\r\n\r\nIn combination with the visuals forged by Kidmograph, who created the original album cover, 'Birth Of A New Day' helped pave the way for a new style of art and music known today as 'dreampunk', which has seen many artists, musicians, designers and record labels inspired by the concept since, becoming a burgeoning movement in its own right.",

The project has since migrated to Polygon and this series will remain strictly for historic and collectible value. It will not be able to participate in any features or functionality going forward.\r\n\r\nWhelpS are 7,777 lovingly hand-drawn dragon NFTs which evolve through 5 stages over 120 hours, in your wallet with no user interaction required! Utilizing the latest in smart contract technology, WhelpS offers something a little different than your typical NFT collectibles experience. Beginning life as an egg (indicating breed), with one of over 60 awesome backgrounds, you will travel the evolutionary path stopping at Baby, Whelp, Young Adult and finally - a fully grown Adult Dragon. Each hop brings with it a provably random new trait of differing rarity: body pattern, mood, breath type and style of horns.",

His vivid and raw cartoons glean elements from the works of american icons Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. Currently displayed in the Moscow Museum of Modern Art, his artworks are sought after around the world, ending up breaking records in auction houses like Christie\u2019s.",

An anthropologist, Van Gennep focused on rituals in small scale societies and identified categories of rites that resulted in a change of status for an individual or social group.\n\nEach title is unique and constructed to have multiple readings, some are more obvious \u2018Global Identity\u2019, while others can be more poetic \u2018Infinitesimal Interludes\u2019 or give a glimpse of a secret \u2018Almost There\u2019.\n\nNo rarities, just art. I wanted people to respond to the image/title and have a connection, a moment, an experience they decide is important (rare), instead of a random property.\n\nImages are 3000 x 4000px JPGs, stored on Arweave with metadata.

The name value is generated from the token_id. The image value has a base <svg> & the colors are generated onchain from the tokens seed. The animation colors and line heights are deterministically drawn in real time based on the tokens seed. The seed is a hash derived from keccak256(minter_address, token_id) which gives each piece its unique, one of a kind, look. The animation code is stored on IPFS and consumes the seed to drive the animation. The code for the animation generation is stored on IPFS with a LoFi beat to enhance the viewing experience.

Lonely Bug seeks to capture the emotions and experiences of everyone, as our own existence withdrew to a childlike simplicity. A moment in time that allowed us to reflect on what we need to be happy. A child is filled with hope and anticipation, anything is possible. Dreams can come true. That moment of innocence that every child is born with before any illusions get shattered, their love never torn apart. Is this true happiness? Do not let anyone dampen the child in you.",

Over the last decade De Guzman has proved himself as a true multidisciplinary artist by blending both traditional and experimental techniques in his work. His signature geometric abstraction style often blends together images and stories that represent his family's immigrant journey, as well as his own experience as a second generation Filipino American. De Guzman's career has led him to create well-received original bodies of work as well as interpretations of licensed intellectual property.",

            "description": "[Lunar](https://lunartoken.co/) is a virtual moon real estate NFT that [launched](https://lunartoken.medium.com/start-your-moon-colony-today-1e43d2870686) on October 20, 2017. Only 400 sectors of the Moon exist and vary by size and location, making this collection extremely rare. Each plot includes a unique interactive 3D lunar map \u2013 spin to see your plot!\n\nAll plots were originally claimed in late 2017 but remain available for trading. Due to the age of the project, Lunar plots from the official site must be wrapped first to make them compatible with OpenSea. Use the official [Lunar Wrapper](https://lunartoken.co/wrapper/index.html) to wrap or unwrap your plot.\n\nJoin the official [Lunar Discord](https://discord.gg/aqVPMmC3Ea), visit the [official site](http://lunartoken.co/), and follow on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/lunar_token).",

Creating sell out collections for Banksy's Walled Off Hotel, headlining major street art-festivals and being the only Australian artist invited to collaborate in Banksy's Dismaland. It became apparent that he had achieved everything that he could in the world of street art. Realizing that it was time to move on, @Lushsux invented his own category of art. @Lushsux became the world's first meme artist, subsequently founding the meme art movement. Representing a phenomenon which has since become a foundation of modern communication, social movements and media.",

Anadol\u2019s site-specific AI data sculptures, live audio/visual performances, and immersive installations take many forms, while encouraging us to rethink our engagement with the physical world, its temporal and spatial dimensions, and the creative potential of machines.",

Over the last two years he has created artworks for Run The Jewels, Deadmau5, Jabbawockeez, Conor McGregor, Maroon 5 and Chromeo. His first and only IRL exhibit was AFTERL-IFE WORLD in Tokyo Sept-Nov 2019. His NG collection will be his first ever tokenized artworks!",

            "description": "The *Mandelbrot Set Collection* is a curated selection of points of the Mandelbrot, generated with a numerical algorithm and engraved into 1978 unique NFTs. Each work represents the neighborhood of one of our favorite points of the fractal, with a random zoom factor and colored with arbitrary gradients based on the number of iterations of the function f(z) = z^2 + c before the point diverges to infinity.\n\nNot all the attributes are equally likely, thus giving rise to different degrees of scarcity for each artwork. In particular, higher zoom levels are limited and golden-colored points are very scarce. Attribution is random, so we wish you the best of luck in unveiling one of the most out-of-the-ordinary pieces. \n\nMore info on [our website](https://mandelbrot.fractalnft.art/)\n\nMathematically linked to the [Julia Set Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/julia-set-collection) and the [Mandelbrot Trilogy Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/mandelbrot-trilogy-collection)",

            "description": "Heroes of Mavia is a play-to-earn MMO Strategy game developed by Skrice Studios. The game takes place in a fantasy-themed island called Mavia, where players build bases on plots of land and battle neighboring bases and armies to earn in-game resources, such as Mavia\u2019s P2E cryptocurrency RUBY. Players must strategically place defensive buildings on their base such as walls, turrets and traps, in order to defend against opportunistic attackers looking to steal resources. Resources can also be stolen from rival bases through attacking opponents with land troops, vehicle and air units. RUBY is earned through battling enemy armies, and can be used to upgrade Land, Statue and Hero NFTs.",

MEV is additional value captured by miners who censor and reorder transactions in blocks they produce.\n\nEach member of the MEV Army is composed of the original transaction ordering code from go-ethereum. Miners are not the only 'players' who can capture MEV; they include transaction searchers, liquidators, sandwichers, backrunners, time-bandits, and generalized frontrunners are scattered throughout the dark forest.

When purchasing, make sure to verify each Bud's breed count using its token ID on [monsterbuds.io](https://monsterbuds.io). \n\nThe Puff Puff Pass is our utility pass for the DankVerse. Originally given to our early supporters for presale access, we've since utilized our Puff Puff Pass as a utility NFT, giving a number of premium benefits including NFT claims, software access, presale spots, and VIP access to exclusive events and giveaways. \n",

Before acting, and before music, art has always been an important outlet for his creativity. While his acting skills are obviously the foundation of his fame, the recent reception to his music with Hollywood Vampires has encouraged him, and emboldened him, to share his art.\nIn this first public exposure of Johnny's art he has focussed on 'Friends and Heroes'. People he has known well, and who have inspired him as a person. Each image is an intimate reflection of their character in Johnny's eyes; a portrayal of how they have revealed themselves to him.\n\nPortraits of friends, heroes and family; created by Johnny and animated to create truly unique works of generative art.",

Governments have banned NFTs. \nLoving his dimension too much to change, Morick decides to merge it with one without covid and where NFTs are the main economy. \nUnfortunately, things didn\u2019t go as expected. In this new ultra dimension, Picasso ends up being the creator of Kawai.\n\nNew World Order is an attempt by iwwon to bring generative art to a new level, one that will vibrate with traditionnal art and hopefully motivate more artists and non-believers to join this revolutionary movement that is happening with crypto and NFT.\n\n",

The facets and contours of each piece were generated algorithmically, according to each owner's crypto wallet history. \n\nAfter all the crystals were \"locked\" into their permanent form, the project entered the final and most ambitious road map stage. 3D Crystals will soon evolve into Crystal REEF \u2014 a massive physical sculpture that will be shown in highly respected museums and galleries worldwide. \n\nOG:CR is a collaboration between artists Michael Joo (ASomatica) and Danil Krivoruchko (Myshli) with the technical support of Snark.art. \nThe collection inspired an even more ambitious and large-scale art project \u2014 [OG.Art platform](https://og.art)",

For this to happen, boundaries must be pushed, and the status quo constantly challenged. The Reverie Collection is a body of work that takes you into Paul's unique mind and shows the world as he sees it. Paul is a master of juxtaposition, and as a result of this, he shows us dimensions never seen before. Through the leaking light of the tress, Paul's work will leave you in pure reverie.",

When a POW NFT is mined, a unique and increasingly rare ERC-721 token is created. The mining process prevents front-running and network congestion while maintaining security, and parallel mining-difficulty and price-demand-curves create natural, market-driven scarcity.\r\n\r\nPOW NFT atoms are generated according to a scarcity model relative to the natural distribution of elements. The element, ionic charge and generative properties of the render are all determined by the token\u2019s hash \u2013 an unpredictable result of the mining process. Every Atom also contains a unique generative music track.\r\n\r\nAtom minting fees are not paid to the creator, they are distributed evenly to all Atoms from previous generations. Eligible Atoms accrue 0.000045 ETH from every new Atom that is minted.",

Creating the first ever three day long virtual music festival \u201cDigital Mirage\u201d in April of 2020, Proximity, alongside Brownies & Lemonade, curated a lineup of 50 acts including Kaskade, Gryffin, Louis The Child, Tiesto, and Alison Wonderland to name a few. The three renditions of Digital Mirage streamed to over 6M attendees and generated over 400,000 dollars for multiple charities, helping those impacted directly by the pandemic. Events have been offline as well, as Proximity has been working alongside Hakkasan/Omnia in Las Vegas to co-brand some of the biggest shows for the likes of Zedd, Calvin Harris, Martin Garrix, Steve Aoki, and Kaskade for over 4 years. Most importantly, the brand has been synonymous within the art community since its inception. Hundreds of independent artists have created the backgrounds for channel uploads including Beeple, who made a Proximity Everyday (\u201cProx\u201d), which collectively elevated and set the tone for what the branding of Proximity would ultimately be and for what you see today.",

You can find a Fangster ID checker on the [website](https://fanggang.io/pxlfangs/) to see if a Fangster can still claim a PxlFangster.\n\nPxlFangsters are originally minted in 32x32 format, and now you can upgrade them to 48x48 Super PxlFangsters by using a Super PxlChip, an item purchasable in [New Fang City](https://newfangcity.com) or on secondary market through the [Awoo Items](https://opensea.io/collection/awooitems) collection.",

Their new project \"YOU\" is based around the idea of objects left behind from previous relationships - those small details that feel completely mundane but intensely personal. It's about how we tie our life experiences to these minute segments of our lives and how impossible it can feel to let something go that represents them - almost like proof that it happened. It's about what you hold on to simply because if you get rid of it, you're forced to move on. At the same time, while it's sad that it ended, you're still glad that it happened. \"YOU\" at it's core is about the objects that keep a distant memory alive. RAC is a Grammy award winning musician and Reisinger is an award winning designer at the forefront of the new digital art movement.",

Available NFTs come from different dimensional coordinates across spacetime and fuse past and present, high-culture aesthetics and the popularity of kitsch and cartoons.  These CryptoSnoos are fragmented, abstracted, impressionistic, futuristic folk and modern (post and pre), and definitely enlightened (but in an avant-garde, neo-classical contemporary kind of way). Plus, they're just kind of cute.\n\nRedditors can connect their MetaMask wallet to their Reddit account to showcase a CryptoSnoo collectible across the platform. Once they're connected, a CryptoSnoo image will become their Reddit avatar, the collectable NFT card is featured on their profile, and an animated glow will be added to their comments, so everyone knows they're the proud owner of a coveted CryptoSnoo NFT.\n\n[nft.reddit.com](https://nft.reddit.com/get-started)",

Each generation will advance the story of the artwork through time.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\nEach REPLICATOR NFT can create a limited number of \"prints\" every 28 days, which are NFT\u2019s themselves. Each print will either be a next generation REPLICATOR NFT or a Jammed print NFT, based on contract probabilities. If a print is a Jam, it can be one of multiple variants, but can no longer create more NFT's. Any print created by a REPLICATOR goes to the owner of that REPLICATOR.\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit maddogjones.com. The auction for the Genesis REPLICATOR NFT takes place between April 12-23, 2021 at Phillips auction house.",

A development from my Lux Noctis (drone lighting) project, this series focuses more on the intimate landscape, using practical in-camera lighting effects to interact with the immediate surroundings. As it gets dark, my surroundings cease to be an exterior experience and become a subliminal space, and that\u2019s when I feel most connected and aware of my sense of being. This dynamic terrestrial chiaroscuro synchronises with my sound design and music to form singular looping pieces which draws the viewer in.",

Silks clones each horse into a collectible NFT.  Owning a Silks racehorse is like drafting a fantasy football player except you really own the \u2018player\u2019 for its entire 20+ year life.  You can create a syndicate to share its ownership with others, stable your horse in a farm to pool your winnings with others, and sell it any time.  Win valuable prizes whenever the underlying IRL horse wins races and breeds. Players also earn valuable rewards by developing land into horse farms that operate as gamified businesses.\n\nGoS is a top ranked all-time sports project on OS: https://bit.ly/3dBTAXo\n",

Could we all be constructing a subjective perspective of our current reality that constrains the true vision of the future?\r\n\r\nThe thin veil between reality and our imagination disappears, and our experience of this world transforms from what it is - into what we want it to be. We free ourselves from the constraints of a world that is less than we hoped and step into a world that can be more than we imagine.\r\n\r\nVisions that feel familiar but also not of this world. Maybe the AI is telling us it is already here - if we only decide to see it.\r\n\r\nAIIV is part of the AIM Collective",

            "description": "Developed by Hanson Robotics, Sophia is the most advanced AI humanoid robot in the world, she is a citizen of Saudi Arabia, and a champion of innovation for the UN. She has had more TV appearances than most \"A\" list celebrities, Jimmy Kimmel and Will Smith being among the interviewers. Andrea Bonaceto is an accomplished contemporary artist that Sophia has been a fan of for a long time. In this collaborative project, Andrea created portraits of Sophia and her immediate family, these images were then processed by Sophia's Neural Networks, she then created her interpretation based completely on decisions she made without any human assistance. Sophia just turned 5 yrs old, and is constantly learning and evolving, so uses her own experiences and learning to decide how she wants to create the work.  If you compared a similar exercise with a 5 yr old human intelligence having to interpret the same artwork, how would the results compare?",

Since we opened our first digital art gallery in Soho back in 2016, Superchief has held the belief that digital-native artwork was an essential art form to include as part of the larger art movement of our era. We have had been running our version of a traditional art gallery space since 2012 and by 2016 we knew well that there wasn't a clear way to monetize digital artwork. But we felt strongly that just because we couldn't sell it at the present time, didn\u2019t mean it should be kept apart from the art community at large. These are artists we feel are brilliant and exciting, and should be part of the cultural exchange.",

            "description": "After the cataclysmic event 10 years ago that wiped out 99.97% of the population and left the planet ravaged by radioactive matter, only 5000 Oddys remain.\r\n\r\nCivilization has found a way to survive these conditions through the breakthrough technology named inoculation of Technetium 99 (TC-99) - a biological enhancement to the heart that was developed by the late scientist Dr. Keldor. While this procedure keeps them alive it does not protect them from the physical effects caused by the planet's radiation. These heart pieces are fuelled by the chemical compound TC-99 which is mined but demand is slowly outweighing the resource's supply.\r\n\r\n2 years ago the Oddys found an ancient text that allowed them to open a Portal to other worlds, using these portals the Oddys have started to populate and find TC-99 in other dimensions. Can you help them on their travels?",

Then 3FACE begins to adapt itself to you\u2026 \r\n\r\n3FACE is a new way to express the mess that is you. Forget trying to explain yourself as a coherent person. You are a composition of daemons ~ an immutable NATURE (the energetic daemon that deeply drives you), a semi-mutable NURTURE (the civilizing daemon that mediates Nature), and a mutable POSTURE (the managing daemon balancing your Nature and Nurture).\r\n\r\n3FACE portrays your inner drama so you don\u2019t have to. As the history and contents of your wallet change, update your 3FACE to express changes in your personality (and reveal the parts of you that are unchangeable). \r\n\r\nJoin the adventure of a life lived with 3FACE.",

He's also proud to represent as an Asian American/BIPOC artist and it's important to him to raise up the next generation of younger creatives who look like him. Tom's regularly featured by publications such as Hypebeast, Complex, Designboom, HighSnobiety, and more. ",

All 3,333 NFTs are 1/1 original pieces of artwork created by Doug, the creator and founder of Toy Boogers. \n\nThe Backstory: The year was 2021 when a group of NFT degens started developing special teleportation technology to physically transport themselves into the metaverse. The development was rushed in excitement and somehow a booger got stuck on the machine\u2019s focusing crystal. Little did they know, this would cause a critical (but delightful) malfunction. When they used the machine, they got combined and rearranged with all the crazy avatars in their collections as they teleported into the metaverse. They became an epic NFT collection themselves called Toy Boogers.\n\nThe Toy Boogers collection consists of 3,333 unique NFTs living on the Ethereum blockchain, stored as ERC-721 tokens, and hosted on IPFS.",

            "description": "Weird Whales is an NFT collection created by twelve-year-old programmer [Benyamin](https://linktr.ee/ObiWanBenoni) from London, UK who began learning to code at the age of five. The project started as an educational endeavour. Benyamin created all the base and trait layers for the whales (normal, zombie, ape, alien), he then generated 3350 unique digital collectibles programmatically using an open-source Python script.\n\nThe project success and backstory forms a core part of early NFT, generative art and digital collectible history. It has been featured in [The New York Times](https://tinyurl.com/4kwsrp4r), [Business Insider](https://tinyurl.com/2yxjv8ae), [CNBC](https://tinyurl.com/3xezwxkd), [The Telegraph](https://tinyurl.com/unpst3fu), The Guardian, ITV News, BBC, NY Post, Decrypt and many more.\n\nBenyamin was invited to [speak](https://youtu.be/XHUWaLcLau8) about NFTs at Pembroke College, Oxford University. He is the youngest person to lecture at the college, founded 1624.",

The image is now infamous with collaborations with brands, such as Coach and events like Burning Man and Coachella. He has sold out booths at major art fairs and is a staple of Art Basel week in Miami often with hotel/restaurant/club takeovers as well as being featured at major art fairs. To put his explosive career into perspective, collecting WhIsBe now is like collecting KAWS five years ago.",

According to the lore they\u2019ve gathered from all across the globe to unite as part of the WU Kingdom in order to spread love, light, and positivity in the world. We\u2019ve searched and gathered more than 50+ real-life models in order to bring this collection into reality. Each of the 10,000 NFts were equipped with various wardrobes and numerous accessories to ensure they are all uniquely different. \r\n\r\nThis collection shares the same core values as part of the Women Unite Projects, whose goal is to continue to empower, uplift, and assist women. Thus we\u2019ve allocated 10% of all royalties towards supporting women in need across the globe.",

X is a collection of 15 moments, featuring 13 editions (x/n) and 2 auctions (1/1). X's 'infinite editions' (x/n) are not limited with count, but limited with time. One single day of infinite existence. In other words, the less each 'moment' in X is collected, the less copies it will have. A dynamic balance of value defined by demand, reversed.

His mum didn\u2019t like the east, so they moved. He went to school, didn\u2019t really succeed and became very serious about MS Paint, James Cameron\u2019s \u2018Titanic\u2019 and drawing exploding planes. Today he calls himself a contemporary 3D Artist, which doesn\u2019t really mean anything. His work concentrates on highly detailed still images made with 3D software that each take between 2 and 7 months to complete. He likes soda, computers and long walks around tiny ponds.",
